# Fitness Tracker

## Project Description

This is a fitness and exercise tracking application. This program will allow the user to create a fitness routine comprised of several different exercises. The user can choose from cardio, muscular, and stretching exercises. Admins can create exercise templates which the user will draw from. The user can start or view a routine with a live timer to help them track their exercises in real time. Completed routines will appear in a history statistics section where the user will track their progress.
